### Project Title
US Bike Share Data analysis with Python (Nanodegree Program "Programming for Data Science with Python")

### Description
The project is about analyzing large datasets with Python. Therefore we were asked to write a Python Application, that analyzes the datasets of three major US cities by filtering by city, month and day.

### Application Instructions
* Start the app with the terminal
* A Filter Gui should appear
* Select the filter (city, month, day), confirm it and press the button "Press this button and see the results in the terminal screen"
* Then go back to the terminal screen to see the statistics as result.
* You will be asked twice if you want to see a chart.
* After that you will be asked if you want to see the raw data analyzed.
* You will have the option to display the analyzed data frame in steps of five rows or all of the data at once.
* You can always exit by pressing enter
